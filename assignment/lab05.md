```

# Purpose of the Script
The starter_kit.sh script automates the setup of a basic project directory structure by creating four main folders: project/, scripts/, docs/, and data/. It also adds a placeholder README.md file inside each folder to ensure they are not empty and ready for further content. Finally, it confirms completion by printing ‚ÄúStarter Kit Ready!‚Äù.

Q what does mkdir -p do?
A It makes an empty parent directory. 

Q why is automation useful in devops?
A Automation is useful in devops because:
   - consistency: tasks run in a same way, reducing errors. 
   - speed: faster builds, tests and deployments. 
   - Reliable: Less human errors, more stable system.
